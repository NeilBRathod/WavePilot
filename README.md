Unfortunately, I ran out of time before I could include all the features originally planned.

Given more time, I would have included:
1. Particle effects for water splashing
2. Additional variation in the curves of Sunseeker boats

Additional features I think would enhance the user experience:
1. Settings such as sensitivity and performance scalability
2. Compass heading UI
3. Additional obstacles
4 .Additional docking steps"
